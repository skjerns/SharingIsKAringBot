# SharingIsCaringBot
A Telegram bot that helps to manage Telegram supergroups


This bot will do four things (development ongoing):

- [x] Remove the "join" message when new users enter the group
- [x] Send a friendly reminder whenever someone replies to a message within the main chat (as replies should be sent privately)
- [x] Last but not least: Forward all it's actions to a separate group, so that the administrators can keep track of what the bot has been doing
- [ ] Ask new users to verify themselves to prevent spam
