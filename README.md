# SharingIsCaringBot
A Telegram bot that helps to manage Telegram supergroups


This bot will do four things:

1) Remove the "join" message when new users enter the group
2) Ask new users to verify themselves to prevent spam
3) Send a friendly reminder whenever someone replies to a message within the main chat (as replies should be sent privately)
4) Last but not least: Forward all it's actions to a separate group, so that the administrators can keep track of what the bot has been doing

Currently under development :)
